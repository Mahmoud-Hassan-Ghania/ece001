  <h1>How Programming Languages Works</h1>
  <p style="font-size:20px">The computer only understand to distinct types of data(on-off). The computer is a collection of transistor. Anythig that computer can do is nothing more than a unique combination of some transistor turned on and some of them are off. Binary code is representation of these transistor as 1s when the transistor is on and 0s when the transistor is off.8 digit represent an 8 transistor. It will be difficult to write programs with 0s and 1s Like (Machine Code)Low level languages,so the Low level programming language has developed to use a keyword,function and class that is similar to English word(High level programing languages). After writing a program with High level programming languages the computer can't understand this codes so it has to translate all the code in a program into a series of ons and offs that it can understand.</p>

     <li style="font-size:20px">The Machine language is directly executed as binary code</li>
